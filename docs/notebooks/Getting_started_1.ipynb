    "### What is a Lipschitz constant\n",
    "The `deel-lip` package allows to control the Lipschitz constant of a layer or of a whole neural network. The Lipschitz constant is a mathematical property of a function (in our context of work, a layer or a model) that characterizes how much the output of the function can change with respect to changes in its input. \n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical terms, a function $f$ is Lipschitz continuous with a **Lipschitz constant L** or more simply **L-Lipschitz** if for any given pair of points $x_1,x_2$, $L$ provides a bound on the rate of change of $f$:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$||f(x_1)-f(x_2)||\\leq L||x_1-x_2||.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, given a 1-Lipschitz dense layer (a.k.a fully connected layer) with a weight matrix $W$ and a bias vector $b$, we have for any two inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$: $$||W.x_1+b-(W.x_2+b)|| \\leq 1||x_1-x_2||.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 The norm we refer to throughout our notebooks is the Euclidean norm (L2). This is because `deel-lip` operates with this norm. You will find more information about the role of the norm in the context of adversarially robust 1-Lipschitz deep learning models in the notebook titled 'Getting Started 2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A simple requirement for creating 1-Lipschitz neural network\n",
    "The composition property of Lipschitz continuous functions states that if you have a function f that is $L_1$-Lipschitz and another function g that is $L_2$-Lispchitz, then their composition function h = (f o g) which applies f after g is also Lipschitz continuous with a Lipschitz constant $L \\leq L_1$ * $L_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feed-forward or sequential neural network is essentially a stack of layers, where each layer transforms the output of the previous layer(s) and feeds its output to the next ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the composition property of Lipschitz functions, *it suffices for each of the n individual layers of a neural network model to be 1-Lipschitz, for the whole model to be 1-Lipschitz*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, given a 1-Lipschitz dense layer parametrized by $(W_1,b_1)$, and a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation layer which is naturally 1-Lipschitz, the combination of the two is also 1-Lispchitz.   \n",
    "This is shown in the equations below, where we have for any two inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$||W_1.x_1+b_1-(W_1.x_2+b_1)||\\leq 1||x_1-x_2||,$$\n",
    "$$||ReLU(x_1)-ReLU(x_2)||\\leq 1||x_1-x_2||,$$\n",
    "and:\n",
    "$$||ReLU(W_1.x_1+b_1)-ReLU(W_1.x_2+b_1)||\\leq 1||W_1.x_1+b_1-(W_1.x_2+b_1)||\\leq 1^2||x_1-x_2||.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `deel-lip` package allows to create 1-Lipschitz neural networks, by providing the user with means to enforce the Lipschitz constant at one on a selected set of layers (such as dense layers). \n",
    "It also ensures that 1-Lipschitz continuity is retained during training.\n",
